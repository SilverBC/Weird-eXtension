# Multi-Functional Extension
#### Description:

This Extension has 3 main parts: 
1) Video Control 
2) Color Manipulation 
3) Alarm

Video Control: 
1) Reset (resets the video speed back to 1)
2) Speed adjustment (allows you to manipulate video speed by inputting the %)
3) Download Video (*Doesn't quite work because different websites use different schemas which made this part beyond the scope of the final project*)
4) Back (brings you back to the main page of the extension)

Color Manipulation: 
1) Red/Green/Blue (two types of red-green and 1 blue-yellow color blindness filters)
2) Monochrome (monochromatic filter)
3) Blindness (Basic blurring of the website)
4) Back (brings you back to the main page of the extension)

Timers:
1) allows you to enter time in (hh:mm:ss) format
2) Back (brings you back to the main page of the extension)
